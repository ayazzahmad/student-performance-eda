# Student Performance Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the factors associated with student exam performance.  
The focus is on identifying patterns, relationships, and insights from the data without applying machine learning models.

---

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Student Performance dataset  
- The dataset contains academic, behavioral, and socio-economic attributes of students along with their exam scores.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of exam scores
- Understand how study habits and attendance relate to performance
- Examine the role of socio-economic factors such as family income
- Identify which factors show the strongest association with exam outcomes

---

## Analysis Approach
The analysis follows a structured EDA workflow:
1. Data inspection and sanity checks  
2. Univariate analysis of key variables  
3. Bivariate analysis between exam score and selected factors  
4. Correlation analysis of numerical variables  
5. Insight-driven conclusions

## Key Insights
- Exam scores are concentrated around the mid-range, with few extreme values.
- Attendance and hours studied show the strongest association with exam performance.
- Study hours exhibit diminishing returns beyond moderate levels.
- Family income shows a modest association with exam scores, with significant overlap across groups.
- Lifestyle factors such as sleep hours and physical activity show weak linear relationships with exam performance.
